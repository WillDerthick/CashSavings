Howdy, this promgram can track physical savings that you don't have stored in the bank.

Step 1, set your own goal: Open CashSavings.py and edit the "Goal" variable to whatever you like (950 is default)
Step 2, set your starting cash: Open BalEdit.py and change the "TotalBalance" variable to the current balance you have (0 is default)

You're all set any changes you make will be saved!
